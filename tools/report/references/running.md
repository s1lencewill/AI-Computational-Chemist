## Report modes

- **Stage synthesis**: use after a calculation wave to brief the user/critic. It may
  include validated evidence that is not yet accepted, but every claim must show its
  status (`validated`, `accepted`, `inconclusive`, `needs-follow-up`, `waived`) and
  list the follow-up task or decision needed. It is not a final deliverable and not a
  prerequisite for first engine input generation or HPC submission.
- **Final report**: use only after relevant claims are accepted or explicitly waived as
  limitations, no open `needs-follow-up` blocks final conclusions, and the report gate
  passes. It consumes accepted claims by default.

## Flow

1. Choose the report mode. If any critic outcome is `needs-follow-up` and no human
   waiver exists, write a stage synthesis and create/point to the follow-up tasks.
2. Run the pre-report soft gate in `validation.md`: decide whether free-energy corrections, DOS/PDOS, charge/work-function, or another low-cost analysis is needed before claims are drafted. Do the analysis when it is needed, or record a visible waiver/limitation.
3. Generate the figures (`tools/ovito`) from the relaxed final structure. For VASP
   relaxations, the report figure source is `CONTCAR`, not the input `POSCAR`, unless
   `POSCAR` is explicitly documented as a copy of the final `CONTCAR`. For each model,
   render **orthographic top + side** views and assemble them side by side as one
   `(a)`/`(b)` panel: `(a)` top on the left, `(b)` side on the right. Where a
   charge/valence claim is made, color the atoms by Bader charge with a colorbar
   (`--color-by`) and assemble that view with the same-view plain element-colored render
   into one `(a)`/`(b)` panel. Zoom or crop side-view panels to the
   slab/adsorbate/active-site region so empty vacuum does not dominate the figure. Keep
   the source subimages and panel assembly command as provenance (see
   `tools/ovito/references/structure-rendering.md`).
4. Write a **results table of relative energies** (E_ads, E_bind, ΔE/ΔG, barriers) — not total energies. State the reference state in the caption.
5. Write the report **manifest** (JSON, below) referencing the paragraphs, tables, and figure files.
6. `uv run scripts/build_report.py manifest.json -o report.docx`.
7. Run the full `validation.md` checklist before handing over. Fix anything the builder flags on stderr.

## Manifest schema (JSON)

```json
{
  "title": "Computational response to peer review",
  "subtitle": "Manuscript NNN — drafted for the authors",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "R2.8 — interfacial Pt valence state",
      "level": 1,
      "paragraphs": [
        "Quote the comment. State what was computed and the method (one line confirming the manuscript's settings). Give the result with units and provenance, then the resulting manuscript change.",
        "..."
      ],
      "tables": [
        {"caption": "Relative energies (eV) and Bader charges; CO referenced to gas-phase CO.",
         "columns": ["Model", "E_ads(CO) (eV)", "Bader q(Pt) (e)"],
         "rows": [["Pt4 cluster", "-1.97", "+0.05"],
                  ["Pt single-atom +Ov", "-3.04", "-0.21"]]}
      ],
      "figures": [
        {"path": "figs/pt4_top_side_panel.png",
         "caption": "Pt4/anatase(101) model: (a) orthographic top view; (b) zoomed orthographic side view.",
         "width_in": 6.2},
        {"path": "figs/pt4_charge_panel.png",
         "caption": "Same side-view geometry: (a) element-colored ball-and-stick render; (b) Bader-charge-colored render with symmetric colorbar.",
         "width_in": 6.2}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `level`: 1–3. Tables get a caption **above**, figures a caption **below**; both auto-numbered.
- Paragraphs are plain text (the builder keeps assembly mechanical — write prose in the package, not markup here).
- Keep figure files beside the manifest (relative paths resolve from the manifest's directory).

## Report skeleton (peer-review response — the flagship case)

1. **Summary / cover** — what was computed, one line per comment outcome.
2. **Per comment** (one section each): quoted comment → method line → result (relative energies + the paired structure/charge figure) → manuscript change. Mark `contradicts`/`inconclusive` outcomes plainly.
3. **SI material** — full tables (relative energies, units, convergence) + figures with complete captions, paste-ready.
4. **Revision changelog** — where the manuscript changed and why.
5. **Calculation directory index** — a final table mapping every Figure/Table to the directory its data was computed in (e.g. `Figure 1 → calc/pt4_ads/`, `Table 2 → calc/co_configs/`). This lets a human trace any number back to its raw inputs/outputs for checking and archival. Always include it; it is the provenance backbone of the report.

For a generic calculation report, drop the per-comment framing and use: objective → method → results (relative energies + figures) → validation → limitations.

For a stage synthesis, add an opening section named "Current Status" with:

- accepted claims so far;
- validated evidence still awaiting critic/user acceptance;
- `needs-follow-up` tasks with IDs, purpose, and expected next decision;
- waived limitations, with decision provenance.

## Figures: the pairing rule in practice

Never present a Bader charge / bond length / valence claim as a bare number. The structure figure *is* the evidence: atoms colored by the quantity (+ colorbar), the few decisive atoms labeled, top **and** side ortho views so geometry is unambiguous. Combine with a DOS/PDOS panel when the electronic-structure argument needs it (`knowledge/scientific-visualization.md`).

For report-ready structure figures, the unit consumed by the manifest should usually be
the assembled panel image, not the individual top/side or charge/plain subimages:

- model geometry: `(a)` top view on the left + `(b)` zoomed/cropped side view on
  the right in one figure;
- charge/property evidence: `(a)` plain element-colored view + `(b)` same-view
  property-colored view in one figure;
- side views should be zoomed/cropped to the chemically relevant slab/adsorbate region
  unless the full vacuum/cell height is part of the claim.
