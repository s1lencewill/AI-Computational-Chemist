# CP2K

Task types: **single-point** (`RUN_TYPE ENERGY`), **optimization** (`GEO_OPT`, `CELL_OPT`), **electronic analysis** (DOS/PDOS, band structure, orbitals, charge/population/bonding post-processing), **reaction path** (`RUN_TYPE BAND`, CI-NEB, TS validation), **vibrations** (`VIBRATIONAL_ANALYSIS`, phonons through `phonopy`), **dynamics** (AIMD, thermostats/barostats, PIMD, metadynamics), **semiempirical screening** (DFTB/xTB), and **advanced properties** (hybrids, DFT+U, CDFT, TDDFT/XAS, NMR/EPR, GW, QM/MM).

## Required inputs

- Structure and periodicity: cell vectors, coordinate source, PBC directions, vacuum/slab/low-dimensional intent.
- Method: functional, dispersion, basis/potential file names, per-element `&KIND` basis and pseudopotential, charge/spin/magnetism.
- Numerical policy: `CUTOFF`, `REL_CUTOFF`, k-point/supercell policy, SCF strategy, smearing/added MOs if needed.
- Electrostatics: Poisson/periodicity model for molecules, slabs, 2D/1D systems, charged cells, SCCS, and work functions.
- For reproductions: source settings override local defaults; do not invent U values, basis choices, or convergence criteria.

## Workflow

1. Decide the scientific question first; if it is code-agnostic, read the matching `knowledge/` doc before choosing CP2K settings.
2. Build the input from `running.md` or a verified example; keep all compared energies on the same functional, basis/potential, grid, k-policy, SCF, smearing, electrostatics, and correction settings.
3. Preflight: `uv run scripts/check_inputs.py input.inp`; for novel setups, run `cp2k -c input.inp` and a short smoke test.
4. Execute through `hpc-submit` for durable local/Slurm/PBS runs; before writing
   the job script, read the target `~/.cluster-agents.md`.
5. Validate: `uv run scripts/parse_cp2k.py output.out`; apply `validation.md`. On failure, use `errors.md`, change one thing, and rerun.

## Hard guardrails

- `PROGRAM ENDED AT` only proves CP2K terminated; convergence and scientific validity still need task-specific checks.
- `&KIND` basis/potential choices are part of the method. Do not silently mix basis/potential families across compared energies.
- `CUTOFF`/`REL_CUTOFF` converge the auxiliary grid, not the Gaussian basis-set limit.
- CP2K support for k-points, hybrids, DFT+U, print sections, and properties is version-dependent. Check the current manual for the exact CP2K version before asserting an old limitation.
- For cell optimization, slabs, 2D materials, charged systems, U values, spin states, smearing, hybrid truncation radii, and implicit-solvent parameters, ask the user or reproduce the source. These are scientific choices, not harmless defaults.
