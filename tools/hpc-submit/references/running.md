# Running Jobs: Scheduler Templates and Command Reference

> Load this when: writing a job script (Slurm/PBS), translating scheduler commands, or setting up job arrays and monitoring.

Adapt partition/queue names, module names, and MPI launchers to the actual cluster — these vary everywhere and must be recorded in that cluster's `~/.cluster-agents.md` once learned.

## Submission-script preflight (all engines)

Before drafting a job script for any code (VASP, CP2K, Gaussian, LAMMPS,
DeePMD, phonopy arrays, GROMACS if present, or analysis jobs), read or re-read
the target `~/.cluster-agents.md` in the current execution context:

1. If already running on the target cluster, read the local file directly.
2. If driving a remote cluster, open the persistent session first, read the MOTD,
   then read the remote user's `~/.cluster-agents.md`.
3. Apply `Custom Instructions`, `Scheduler`, `Storage`, `Software Environment`,
   `Computational Codes`, and `Job Script Patterns` before choosing headers,
   modules, launchers, scratch paths, GPU requests, or Python/conda/uv setup.
4. If a required fact is absent or ambiguous, ask/probe for that fact before
   writing or submitting the script. Do not borrow settings from another engine
   or another cluster.

## Slurm: MPI engine job (generic template)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=<job-name>
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=48        # = total MPI ranks per node
#SBATCH --time=24:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=<partition>     # from ~/.cluster-agents.md
#SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out
#SBATCH --error=%x-%j.err

module purge
module load <engine-module>          # from ~/.cluster-agents.md

cd "$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR"
srun <engine-binary>                 # or mpirun -np $SLURM_NTASKS <engine-binary>
```

Engine-specific knowledge — binary variants, input parallelization tags, shared-memory vs MPI models, scratch handling — lives in the engine skill's `running.md` (`vasp`, `gromacs`, `lammps`, `gaussian`, ...); this file owns only the scheduler mechanics.


## Slurm: GPU jobs (engine-neutral mechanics)

Before writing a GPU script, inspect what the site exposes through Slurm and record the actual partition/module choices in the cluster's `~/.cluster-agents.md`, not in committed workflow notes:

```bash
sinfo -o '%P %N %G %c %m'
scontrol show partition <gpu-partition>
scontrol show node <gpu-node>
module avail <engine>
sbatch --test-only <candidate-script>
```

Look for `GRES`/`--gpus` support and GPU type names such as `gpu:v100:8`, `gpu:a100:4`, `gpu:4090:2`, or similar. On clusters with mixed GPU partitions, choose the partition first, then request the exact GPU type. Prefer typed requests such as `--gres=gpu:<type>:4` or the site's equivalent over untyped `--gpus=4`, because an untyped request may land on a different GPU model than intended or even span multiple node types. Use `sbatch --test-only` to verify the script selects a sensible node before real submission.

Generic GPU-job rules, regardless of engine:

- Use a GPU-enabled build of the engine, never a CPU-only MPI build, on GPU nodes.
- Follow the engine's GPU parallelization model for ranks/threads per GPU (for most DFT/MD codes: one MPI rank per GPU); the engine skill carries the launch template.
- Avoid `--gpu-bind=single:1` or any binding that hides peer GPUs unless the site's tested template requires it; GPU-aware MPI/NCCL often needs all peer GPUs visible.
- If the site's documented policy says not to set `--ntasks`, `--cpus-per-task`, or `--mem` for GPU jobs, respect it — some clusters derive CPU/memory allocation from the GPU request, and conflicting directives cause rejection or bad placement.
- Check early stdout/stderr for CUDA/MPI binding errors before letting a long job run.
- Record GPU partition, GPU count/type, module, binary, and launch command in the run notes.

Engine-specific GPU launch templates and INCAR/input parallelization caveats live in the engine skill — for VASP, `tools/vasp/references/gpu-openacc.md`.

## Slurm: job array (phonon displacements, NEB-adjacent batches, conformers)

```bash
#SBATCH --array=1-24%8              # 24 tasks, max 8 concurrent
cd "$(printf 'disp-%03d' "$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID")"
srun vasp_std
```

## PBS/Torque equivalent header

```bash
#PBS -N vasp-relax
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=48:mpiprocs=48
#PBS -l walltime=24:00:00
#PBS -j oe
cd "$PBS_O_WORKDIR"
mpirun vasp_std
```

## Command translation table

| Action | Slurm | PBS |
|---|---|---|
| submit | `sbatch job.sh` | `qsub job.sh` |
| queue (mine) | `squeue -u $USER` | `qstat -u $USER` |
| job detail | `scontrol show job ID` | `qstat -f ID` |
| history/exit code | `sacct -j ID --format=JobID,State,Elapsed,ExitCode,MaxRSS` | `tracejob ID` |
| cancel | `scancel ID` | `qdel ID` |
| hold/release | `scontrol hold/release ID` | `qhold/qrls ID` |

## Monitoring patterns

- First minutes after start: check stderr and engine output for input errors — catching a doomed job early saves the whole walltime.
- Long runs: poll at meaningful intervals (SCF loop in OUTCAR, `mdrun` log/energy output, thermo lines in log.lammps) rather than continuously; `tail -f` only interactively.
- On `TIMEOUT`: VASP relax -> CONTCAR->POSCAR restart; GROMACS -> resume from `.cpt`; LAMMPS -> read restart file; Gaussian opt -> `opt=restart`. Record that the result is a continuation.

## Remote workspace setup (once per campaign)

0. Open a persistent remote session using the local bootstrap (connection command/alias), then read the MOTD and the remote `~/.cluster-agents.md` operating guide. Use the `rsess` skill (`rsess open <topic> <target>`) — it runs tmux on the remote, so state (cwd, loaded modules, venvs) survives across calls and connection drops, and `run` output is captured faithfully in per-command files. If rsess is not available, use whatever persistent-session tool the local bootstrap specifies; never rely on one-shot `ssh host cmd` which loses state between calls.
1. Create the campaign directory tree on the remote.
2. Copy the engine skills' preflight/parser scripts there via the configured transfer route.
3. Ensure a modern Python per the remote `~/.cluster-agents.md` Python recipe (e.g. load conda/uv, or create an agent env and `pip/uv install` what the scripts need, when allowed). Never assume the system interpreter is recent. Repo helper scripts with third-party deps run via `uv run` (inline PEP 723) — but **compute nodes are usually offline**: point `UV_CACHE_DIR` at a shared filesystem and **warm each script's env once on the login node** (just run it once where there is connectivity — first use populates the cache), then jobs run with `uv run --offline` and fetch nothing. Without a warmed cache, a first-ever `uv run` inside a batch job on an air-gapped node will hang trying to reach the index. uv is preferred (point it at a PyPI mirror via `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX` if the default index is slow); as a fallback, prepare a **conda/mamba** env that has the deps and run the scripts with its `python` — use it when a package installs more reliably from conda-forge (ovito has its own channel) or uv/PyPI is blocked. Index/channel mirror URLs come from `~/.cluster-agents.md`.
4. Every stage then runs: stage inputs -> remote preflight script -> submit -> parse with the remote parser script.

## Watcher idiom (chaining stages without polling by hand)

Use the shipped waiter — it confirms a **terminal** state via `sacct` and treats a transient query failure or the job's mere absence from `squeue` as "unknown, keep waiting", never as success:

```bash
scripts/wait_for_job.sh "$JOBID" --poll 120   # exit 0 only on COMPLETED
```

Do **not** hand-roll `until [ -z "$(squeue -h -j "$JOBID")" ]; do sleep; done` — a transient ssh/slurmctld hiccup makes `squeue` return empty and the loop fires a false positive on a still-running job (advancing the next stage onto an unconverged structure).

On wake: a scheduler-terminal state is not convergence — run the engine's own parser (failure outcomes already non-zero-exit the waiter, but silence still looks like success to a parser), then build and submit the next stage.
